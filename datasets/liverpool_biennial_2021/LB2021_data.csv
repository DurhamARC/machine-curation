With some designs featuring 54 stars that represent the 54 countries of Africa, the flags evoke solidarity and collective empathy – while some of their locations speak to Liverpool’s connection with the enslavement of West Africans as part of the transatlantic slave trade. The colours of the flags reflect Pan African symbolism: green, black and red represent Africa’s land, people and the struggles the continent has endured respectively, while yellow-gold represents a new dawn and prosperity. Achiampong has configured these colours into icons that are suggestive of community, motion and the human figure in ascension.For Liverpool Biennial 2021, four of the artist’s flags from his original series are shown - Ascension, Community, Motion and Squadron - as well as four new flag designs that generate new symbolic constitutions;What I hear I Keep – related to the act of sending and receiving messages that resonate.Dualities – related to the connection between those born within the African continent and those of the African Diaspora.Bringers of Life – related to the eternal reverence of the elements that bring and fortify life.Mothership – in praise, honour and respect of the centre of community; Black Womxn.Supported by The African Arts Trust.

Bianchi is interested in how we are connected to objects and how they affect our everyday life;his works reconfigure our perceptions to create a spatial configuration indistinct of bodies and things. For his installation, Bianchi will process discarded objects, mostly car parts, and organic matter such as bioplastics – trying to force integration between conflicting worlds. The structures are complemented by the familiar, though often obscured sounds of the by-products of living bodily systems in their normal day-to-day functions, such as snoring, passing wind, exhalations and sighs. These sounds become the soundtrack to a series of videos where the adventures of strange characters with exceeded bodies were recorded.

Beltrán’s work revolves around his interpretation of forms and figures, which is informed by his research into the intersection between multiple paradigms – Cumbia music, proprioception, quantum physics, the primordial state, the psychopomp and collective psyche. Hinged on his deconstruction of Cumbia, Beltrán brings to the fore that there are multiple ways of being in the world beyond the conventional understanding of the individual. Here, the existence is interpreted by the body through ripples and rhythm – pulling and drawing people in as though they are possessed. Once the unit is overflowed with a multi-layered presence, it transforms into a state that is visually a kin to a kaleidoscopic pattern.

Colquhoun's paintings are concerned with natural processes, systems and cyclical renewal, referencing growth and decay as well as the four essential elements of nature: earth, air, fire and water. Working in the early-to-mid twentieth century, Colquhoun's works were created in a context where a modern understanding of natural processes and science was accelerating, but where science was more receptive to other disciplines and cultural interpretations. Colquhoun's paintings can be read as parascientific – drawing on her interests in Occultism and Surrealism as alternative ways of reading and situating oneself within the world. This particular collection of paintings depicts erupting ritualistic and rhythmic sequences of plant growth, atmospheric phenomena and volcanic activity. Colquhoun's paintings are displayed alongside the work of contemporary artist Linder, who will be creating new collages which respond to Colquhoun and their shared interest in the occult.The above images are a taster of what’s in store for our LB2021 exhibitions, which will open in late spring.""]",https://www.liverpoolbiennial2021.com/site/assets/files/1109/ithell-1.jpeg,"Ithell Colquhoun, Scylla, 1938.

In the assembled works, Channer mimics a geological process that happens on a massively non-human scale using industrial processes that operate on a human scale – a deliberate conflation of scales and kinds of body. Loosely resembling natural rock formations, such as ammonite fossils, Channer’s large-scale sculptures represent the passing and scale of geological time. Bone-shaped structures, created by the application of multiple distortion, stretching and casting techniques, show strata-like ridges on their surfaces. Seeing a bone-like structure amplified to such a degree challenges our perception of what we are made of. The new series of fabric prints show rows of pinetree pleats, induced by a specialist technique that is usually reserved for the fashion industry. The pleating process is considered to be similar to the geological processes involved in the formation of the rock. Channer imagines the pleats as a kind of pleated skin that is porous to different processes, scales and time.Channer’s sculptures are accompanied by the first instalment of new, multi-part audio work by SHELL LIKE (Amy Lay-Pettifer and Fer Boyd). FIRST BIRTH occupies warm shallow waters, expansive sands, rockpools and motorway sidings, voices passing between human, non-human and elemental bodies. Beginning in lapping primordial excavations, zooming close-up to porous rock surfaces, tuning in to dialogues between whirlpools and following the libidos of a human-ish body as it traverses the city - the audio imagines different shapes for the body to rest in - new coils with a hole for your skeleton - that echo the sculptures’ own capacity for horizontal expansion and s-t-r-e-t-c-h.The above images are a taster of what’s in store for our LB2021 exhibitions, which will open in late spring.']",https://www.liverpoolbiennial2021.com/site/assets/files/1112/4.jpg,"Alice Channer, Ammonite, 2019.

In these works, Henrot makes use of the familiar art-historical trope of the mother and child in order to foreground obscured aspects of motherhood and their reflections in society at large. The overriding theme of alienation is crystallized in the figure of the woman expressing milk with a breast pump. By operating on the body as a field of action rather than of identity, the breast pump construes the machine as a model for thinking about the body.

For Linder, the connotations link back to her experience of being carried in her mother\'s womb in Liverpool in 1954 and her billboard presents the “Bower of Bliss” as a safe, deeply pleasurable space, needed now more than ever.Interact with the mural by taking a photo or a selfie – share using #BlowerofBliss and check back to watch as the mural changes over the festival dates.Bower of Bliss is commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from Liverpool ONE and The Estate of Fanchon Fröhlich.This artwork is now open, local residents can plan your visit here.']",https://www.liverpoolbiennial2021.com/site/assets/files/1349/dscf1526-2.jpg,"Linder, Bower of Bliss, 2021.

Composed by English slaver-turned-abolitionist John Newton, the song was reinterpreted as an emblem of the Civil Rights Movement and is still performed today at moments of public ceremony and collective mourning in the US and across the world.Though more widely associated with African American emancipation than with slavery, Muyanga’s reinterpretation of “Amazing Grace” connects the origins of the song to its murkier history, and to Liverpool’s – John Newton lived in the city and sailed on slave ships from Liverpool’s port. The sonic video installation was a performance by Khayelitsha-based mezzo soprano, Tina Mene, and the popular São Paolo protest theatre troupe, Legítima Defesa.
