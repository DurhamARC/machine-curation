pedro-neves-marques-haut,"Pedro Neves Marques presented two newly commissioned films at The Lewis’s Building titled Meat is Not Murder (2021) and The Ovary (2021), under the umbrella of what they term Medieval Bodies in collaboration with music producer and artist HAUT. Imbued with an intimate and sensorial relation to images, Meat is Not Murder narrates the dilemma faced by an animal rights advocate and vegan when confronted with the possibility of eating lab-grown meat. While, accompanied by a cover of Lana Del Rey's ""Let Me Love You Like A Woman,"" The Ovary is a raw and haunting approach to the online fan fiction genre Mpreg (a term short for male pregnancy) and its tense, but also visionary, relation with surrogacy, privilege, and homonormativity. Through image, music, and text, the films create an emotional narrative about the gendering of bodies and science, as well as preconceptions about what is deemed natural and unnatural. Mixing autofiction with research, its images echo contemporary issues surrounding queer reproduction and gestation, fears of artificiality in biotech, and the fluidity between human and nonhuman bodies.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial supported by Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

teresa-solar,"Teresa Solar presented a newly commissioned outdoor installation, titled Osteoclast (I do not know how I came to be on board this ship, this navel of my ark) (2021). The work was originally installed at Exchange Flags, then later relocated to Derby Square.Composed of five kayaks, each sculptural piece reflects on the shape of a bone in the human anatomy. The sculptures anchor on the history of Liverpool as one of the most active ports in facilitating transatlantic trade in Europe. Solar’s work draws a parallel between bones – as hollowed structures, full of cavities, carriers of tissues, veins and cell communities – and vessels, vehicles of migration, transmitters of bodies and knowledge. In contrast to the enormous ships that were, and still are, built and docked in Merseyside, Solar’s kayaks, turned into a disarticulated skeleton, set the human body at sea level and evoke the sometimes-forgottenfragility of the human body over the sea. At the same time, they also celebrate our capacity for transition and transformation.   Liverpool Biennial is delighted to announce the release of a limited edition by Teresa Solar.

serafine1369,"SERAFINE1369 presented durational performance I I I (something flat, something cosmic, something endless) (2021) at Bluecoat Gardens on Sunday 20 March, from 2–8pm.A work made in a moment when all that was there was this body, its dreams and nightmares and cycles and needs, sensations and wanting. I went mining. I haunt this work. I is a collection of already historical circumstances, remembered and un-remembered. I is a crowd. I is a trick of the light.A durational performance inducing a state of expansiveness and detachment from the pressure to create - or be formed by - meaning through conventional narrative arcs. Its duration witnesses / tracks the rhythmic cycles, the peaks and troughs of an endocrine system beyond the arc of climax. The work situates a research and obsession with the unit of ‘one minute’ - asking whether we can transform the stuff of time or whether it transforms us. Considering the invention of colonial time and agency, the ways we inhabit its units of fixed endless measurement, even as this Time slips out of relation to the celestial bodies that have long been its anchor and justification.Working with live and recorded text written over the last year from dreams and heartache and reflection - a wasteland of feeling - I I I (something flat, something cosmic, something endless) is a wide and flat landscape as score for performance.

reto-pulfer,"Reto Pulfer presented a newly commissioned site-specific work titled hyperbolisch ratlos ortlos inhaltslos (2015–21) at The Lewis’s Building. Consisting of immersive textile installations, the work focuses on the relationship between the body and nature. Inspired by his memories of growing up near Switzerland’s largest landscape garden, and his relocation to the Uckermark region of Germany, the work begins with the process of extracting natural pigments from plants and applying the dye onto hand-sewn fabrics, recycled bedsheets, paper and wood to form environmental sculptures. Reflecting the artist’s state of mind, the resulting textiles and objects emerge as large tent-like structures to create a universe which embodies the transformational possibilities of nature. In his live performances he interacts with the space and the objects within it – articulating the fluidity between the body and nature, which both affect and are affected by the other.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia, Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen, Swiss Cultural Fund UK and Hollybush Gardens, London.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

daniel-steegmann-mangrane,"Daniel Steegmann Mangrané presented a newly commissioned outdoor installation at Crown Street Park, and a film at Bluecoat. Steegmann Mangrané’s new outdoor installation, La Pensée Férale (2021), brings into question our position in the world – eroding the Western conceptions of being that separate the world into opposing dualisms, for example, nature and culture. The tree trunk at its centre is a scanned replica of a Pau Rei, a native tree of the Brazilian Mata Atlántica, imbedded with the eye of an Indian pariah dog from Bangladesh. Surrounded by a newly planted forest of black beeches, the work raises questions about subjectivity and our attitude towards our environment, reinforcing that nature is not without perception or feeling.Presented in the UK for the first time, Steegmann Mangrané’s film Fog Dog (2020) is the artist’s first foray into cinematic storytelling. Premiered at the Dhaka Art Summit 2020, the film is a documentation of daily life at the Institute of Fine Arts of Dhaka. Through different narratives – of colonial violence, bodily knowledge, environmental degradation and the stray and phantom dogs which live at the Institute – the film highlights how multiple worlds are interconnected.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with Art Fund support, and the assistance of Bury Art Museum.

martine-syms,"Martine Syms’ video installation Borrowed Lady (2015) from Tate’s collection was presented at Tate Liverpool. Taking a cue from writer Samuel R. Delany's reflections on how feminine characters are constructed through the compositing of ideal physiological and psychological features, Syms draws from her archives to speculate on the influences on her actor's gestures. Syms’ own practice is also formed of conceptual and critical inheritances. Alongside Delaney, Borrowed Lady is also informed by seventeenth century physician John Bulwer's study of hand gestures and their meaning; philosopher Giorgio Agamben's impressions on cinema's recuperation of the politics of gesture; and scholar Alison Landsberg’s formulation of mass popular medias as ""prosthetic"" memory. Syms highlights how common these gestures are, while also commenting on how they have been appropriated and commercialised in branding and advertising aimed at White audiences.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

alberta-whittle,"Alberta Whittle presented film between a whisper and a cry (2019) at Open Eye Gallery. Hinging on memory, trauma and the afterlives of colonialism, the film combines archival footages, contemporary stories, happenings and events, narrative texts and voices, using sound and oral histories as forms of knowledge. Weather is an important visual and audio element of the film, referencing the legacy of colonial extraction as the starting point for present-day climate instability in the Caribbean, while drawing parallels with the exploitation inherent within the contemporary tourist industry. For Whittle, understanding the past becomes the foundation for moving towards present-day healing and nurturing. Through the film, viewers are encouraged to synchronise their bodies to the rhythm of Whittle’s breathing and the conditions of ocean life, invoking a sense of compassion, kinship, groundedness and understanding within one’s own body.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

anu-poder,"Anu Põder’s set of sculptures titled Tongues (1998) from Tate’s Collection were presented at Tate Liverpool. Showing various stages of decay and corrosion, Põder’s sculptures are realistic representations of the human tongue, cut and exaggerated in size, and cast from soap. Working while Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union, Põder’s use of everyday materials alludes to the domesticity expected of women, while the violent imagery of a human tongue removed from its mouth evokes notions of silencing, apprehension and fear. The enlarged size of the tongues gives weight to their presence, emphasising the vitalness of freedom of expression.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

xaviera-simmons,"Xaviera Simmons presented a photographic and moving image installation at Liverpool Cotton Exchange Building. Bringing together existing and new works from her Sundown series (2018-ongoing), Simmons explores the entangled history of the United States, particularly looking at the construction of ‘whiteness’ in relation to the history of the institution of slavery and its legacy. The works assembled draw from a multitude of threads that form the foundations of the contemporary American narrative. This includes colonial America, the Antebellum South, the Jim Crow era of enforced segregation, the Great Migration from rural South to Northern cities, the Civil Rights era, the war on drugs and mass incarceration, as well as the governmentally sanctioned white American terror campaigns that fueled such practices. Interested in how portraiture, language and landscape construct identities, Simmons juxtaposes historical imagery and text against contemporary backdrops of the American landscape.

zineb-sedira,"Zineb Sedira presented a set of prints and sculptures from her Sugar Routes (2013) series at Open Eye Gallery. Sedira’s works recount the history of transoceanic human migration, the triangular trade routes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the continued trade of sugar across the Atlantic for mass consumption. Working in a contemporary context, Sedira’s photographic prints depict sugar extracted from different parts of the world housed in a modern warehouse in the French port city of Marseille. The mountainous piles of sugar present a landscape of extraction where multiple geographies convene and merge with one another; the warehouse becoming an in-between space of encounter before the sugar is processed for consumption. Juxtaposed a sculpture of an anchor made from cane sugar found in the French silo, the works act as a metaphor for migration and diaspora.The series was originally commissioned by Marseille Provence 2013, European Capital of Culture and the Port of Marseille.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

zheng-bo,"Zheng Bo presented a new commission, the fifth of his Pteridophilia series (2016-ongoing), alongside Pteridophilia 1 to 4 at FACT Liverpool. His ongoing film series connects queer plants and queer people, pushing the boundaries of sexuality and love to incorporate the natural world. Zheng Bo’s work is informed by queer ecology, which rejects nature being positioned as existing in binary states – for example, human or non-human, natural or unnatural. Interested in moving beyond human exceptionalism, Zheng Bo situates communities of people and plants as subjects in his films, depicting scenes of physical intimacy between them. Reflecting on the idea of the body as a fluid organism that is continuously shaped by and shaping its environment, Zheng Bo’s work destabilises identity and gender categories, further re-interpreting the relationship between ecology and human sexuality. The film series also raises questions about the complex relationship between terrain and nationality – and how the conquest of countries, land and nature have historically been heteronormative endeavours.Supported by Edouard Malingue Gallery.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

jenna-sutela,"Jenna Sutela presented an audio work titled nnother (2021), together with Elvia Wilk, at the Lewis’s Building, as well an iteration of her ongoing series I Magma (2019-ongoing) at Lush Building. All about symbiosis, nnother deals with the topic of gestation. It presents a conversation between imaginary organisms with both organic and synthetic attributes, one of whom lives inside the other. In addition to the sound piece, Sutela’s neuroplastic sculptural portrait Indigo, Orange and Plum Matter (I Magma cycle) (2021) explores the psychedelic history of technology as well as the topic of wetware, a computer-related idea applying to biological life forms. The three “lava head” glass sculptures, in the shape of the artist’s head, are filled with blobs of liquid and colour in motion. In rotation, they project a light show on the walls in the space. The work celebrates both the fluids and symbionts within us as well as the larger ecosystem that they, and we, interact with and depend upon.nnother is co-authored with the writer Elvia Wilk and co-commissioned by Liverpool Biennial and Science Gallery London, part of King's College.

andre-romao,"André Romão presented six sculptural pieces at Bluecoat. Romão’s sculptures capture moments of transformation between humans, animals, minerals and plants, as well as organic and abstract entities. Each sculpture raises questions about the overlapping of human life and nature. Armour (2019) shows a form as tall as the human body coated in mussels.Testa (2019) is an Italian antique sculpture encrusted with quartz crystals. Pierna izquierda (2019) is a sculptural fragment taking the form of an animalistic limb crafted from wood. In Generator (2019), the fuel of an electric generator is replaced with bright yellow acacia pollen which are seen emerging from the machine – evoking the queerness and sexuality of nature. Moonrise (2019), a large suspended blue Plexiglass disk, evoking a night where normal interactions between bodies and entities are suspended. Heavy Foot (2020) depicts a plant emerging from a life-sized foot made from a bronze cast.

Taking inspiration from the natural world, the sculptures engage with the complexity of object histories, the circulation of objects and their relationships with nature. The seven-and-a-half-feet-tall iron structure titled Mother of Pearl (2019) alludes to the form of a furnace – a facilitator of industry which is dependent on natural materials for fuel – it is figurative and infinite in shape, its rusty exterior contrasted by a smooth abalone shell interior.Select sculptures from Ryan's 'Bad Fruit' series, Bad Lemon (Slice) (2020), Bad Cherries (Legs) (2020) and Bad Peach (Cheeky) (2020), are still on display at Bluecoat until September.

ebony-g-patterson,"Ebony G. Patterson presented hand embellished textile works at Tate Liverpool, including ...fraught...for those who bear/bare witness (2018), as well as new floor work, ... when the cry takes root ... (2021). Patterson considers gardens as a space of both beauty and burial, filled with fleeting aesthetics and mourning. They serve as a “postcolonial” symbol of the past that is never fully buried and barely visible. Patterson’s works further reflect on her interest in the disenfranchised communities of today – particularly of the working class. The objects and materials, each with its own narrative, are assembled together to create a new meaning – yet there is a sense of fragility as they barely hang onto each other. Against the floral backdrop, the objects and figures on the ground-level epitomize images of death – of the bodies that have fallen to the ground. Patterson’s gardens are never far from notions of violence, of memorial, of blood and tears.The new work is commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from VIA Art Fund, Monique Meloche Gallery Chicago, and Rodney Miller.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

ligia-lewis,"As part of the Liverpool Biennial Live Weekend (19 – 20 June), Ligia Lewis presented the documented dance performance Deader than Dead (2020).Ligia Lewis conceived and directed deader than dead in 2020 as an intrigue-based inquiry into deadpan, an impassive mannerism deployed in comedic fashion in order to illustrate emotional distance. The dancers perform to Macbeth’s culminating soliloquy (“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,” a reflection on repetition and meaninglessness), which unfolds through the work in modular parts, each one an illustration or parody of death, stasis, and the void, each one tied to its own carefully selected soundtrack or sample. Full of play and comedic tropes, the work is also a meditation on “playing,” or acting, as well as on tragedy’s recurring cycles and familiarity within Black and brown experience; on time, as it loops; on performance; on touch, as an act of both care and violence. Built in the form of a musical lament, it is a protracted complaint performed ad infinitum, decomposing itself along the way.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

jutta-koether,"Jutta Koether presented a new series of paintings at Tate Liverpool. Deeply rooted in European tradition, Koether’s painting constantly confronts the conditions of its own production as a site of reflection on the act of looking and the different perspectives this act raises according to who is looking, how and when. Koether accentuates a counter-history to the male-dominated canons of art history, claiming a space usually occupied by male painters with her grotesque and guttural works. The red palette of her paintings is deceivingly calm as Koether’s subject and method are both forms of resistance.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from Galerie Buchholz, Berlin/Cologne/New York and Institutfür Auslandsbeziehungen.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

luo-jr-shin,"Luo Jr-shin presented site-specific installation Like a filter, matters passed through you and became a part of you (2021) at The Lewis’s Building. As a continuation of his previous project Like a Urinal in a Nightclub, From Some Golden Liquid Turning into Another (2018), Luo’s set is a nightclub toilet – which is treated as a metaphorical facilitator for material transformation. Like a closed circuit, the installation shifts between a toilet and a nightclub, highlighting the cyclical drinking-urinating behaviour of the human body. Surrogate fluid made from ingredients found in beer coats the floor in the space – a familiar sensation underfoot for clubgoers, which transports the visitor to a certain mood, place or time. Luo’s work also highlights the fluidity of a nightclub toilet in terms of its ambiguity of public and private space, and the exchanging of substance and information – as well as its rigidness in reinforcing binary gender norms.Supported by Ministry of Culture Taiwan (Republic of China).Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

camille-henrot,"Camille Henrot presented a set of newly commissioned sculptures and paintings from her Wet Job (2020-21) series at The Lewis’s Building. In these works, Henrot makes use of the familiar art-historical trope of the mother and child in order to foreground obscured aspects of motherhood and their reflections in society at large. The overriding theme of alienation is crystallized in the figure of the woman expressing milk with a breast pump. By operating on the body as a field of action rather than of identity, the breast pump construes the machine as a model for thinking about the body. It amplifies the shame of animal excess (leaking breasts), of performing alone what should be done with another (like with masturbation), and of requiring the supplementary aid of a machine in the first place. Henrot resists the reduction of motherhood’s embedded subjectivity to biology, as is often done to deprive women’s voices, and provides an intriguing view of alienation in the name of liquidity and consumption.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial, supported by kamel mennour, Paris/London; Metro Pictures, New York; and König Galerie, Berlin/London/Tokyo.

neo-muyanga,"Neo Muyanga presented a newly commissioned project A Maze in Grace (2021) as a video installation at the Lush Building. Muyanga’s composition is inspired by the song “Amazing Grace” – a hymn which is loaded with history. Composed by English slaver-turned-abolitionist John Newton, the song was reinterpreted as an emblem of the Civil Rights Movement and is still performed today at moments of public ceremony and collective mourning in the US and across the world.Though more widely associated with African American emancipation than with slavery, Muyanga’s reinterpretation of “Amazing Grace” connects the origins of the song to its murkier history, and to Liverpool’s – John Newton lived in the city and sailed on slave ships from Liverpool’s port. The sonic video installation was a performance by Khayelitsha-based mezzo soprano, Tina Mene, and the popular São Paolo protest theatre troupe, Legítima Defesa. Legítima Defesa is a multidisciplinary troupe named for Malcolm X’s famed statement that framed strategies of resistance mounted by African Americans against a racist state as ‘legitimate defence.’The video, partially recorded during a performance for the 34th Bienal de São Paulo, was co-commissioned with Fundação Bienal São Paulo, another layer of history is referenced – as ships sailed from Liverpool to West Africa, taking captured slaves to Brazil. The work details some of the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the reimagining of this hymn at this time in history presents an opportunity for introspection.The project also incorporates a new 12” vinyl record, A Grace Project, produced in collaboration with SAVVY Contemporary which will be available from the Liverpool Biennial online shop, and via SAVVY Contemporary network.

laura-huertas-millan,"Laura Huertas Millán presented her film Jíibie (2019) at Bluecoat. The film captures the culture of the coca leaf – a plant which is treated by some indigenous groups in the Americas as part of their kin, or their family network. The film offers a portrait of the surviving ritual of the green coca powder called Jíibie and the integral part it plays as an interlocutor in the ancestral kinship of the Muiná-Muruí community in the Colombian Amazon. The coca leaf is held as a sacred and feminine being, not as a person or product. The properties of enlightenment and spiritual cohesion are said to ‘sweeten the discourse’ and increase the articulation of difficult conversations. Challenging the Western conceptions of nature as something that is separate from human life, the film illustrates how coca forms a crucial part of ancient social practice with legislation as a desirable future; as opposed to the over-extracted Western notion of harvesting cocaine from the leaf and the threat of repressive policies and prohibition that brings to the people.Supported by Centre national des arts Plastiques (Soutien à une recherche/production artistique du Centre national des arts plastiques), PinchukArtCenter, Liverpool Biennial and Fluxus Art Projects.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

linder,"Linder presented a series of photomontage works at Tate Liverpool and a new street-level billboard commission within Liverpool One. Drawing on feminist critiques around the commodification of the female body in society, Linder’s photomontage works challenge contemporary and historical depictions of women in the public eye by combining everyday images from domestic or fashion magazines with pornographic imagery and other archival materials. Linder’s new large-scale billboard commission forms part of her Bower of Bliss (2021) constellation that has its origins in a copy of Oz magazine, which she bought at the Bickershaw Festival in 1972. The centuries old phrase “Bower of Bliss” refers to the birthplace, the point of origin and safety. For the poet Edmund Spenser, the ""Bower of Bliss"" meant ""womb"". For Linder, the connotations link back to her experience of being carried in her mother's womb in Liverpool in 1954 and her billboard presents the “Bower of Bliss” as a safe, deeply pleasurable space, needed now more than ever.Visitors could interact with the mural by taking a photo or selfie to share via social media using #BlowerofBlissThe mural developed over festival dates, with text reading ""Bower of Bliss"" being added at a later stage. Linder's public work also featured as part of Liverpool Biennial's Live Weekend (19–20 June), with a series of dance performances taking place in front of the billboard. The activations comprised of an improvised routine by local dancers Lauren Fitzpatrick and Kirstin Halliday in response to music by composer and musician Maxwell Sterling – extending the key concepts and themes of Linder’s works.

rashid-johnson,"Rashid Johnson presented a large-scale public sculpture titled Stacked Heads (2020) at Canning Dock Quayside. Johnson's sculpture is formed by two distinct head parts in the style of a totem – made from bronze and furnished with plants. The sculpture takes inspiration from his series Anxious Men (2015-ongoing), which evokes a sense of collective anxiety. Incorporating organic elements in his work, the plants which grow from within the sculpture – yucca and cacti – were selected for their endurance to harsh winds and saline water. The plants resilience and the placement of the work at a waterfront location negotiated Liverpool’s transatlantic histories while keeping prescient contemporary concerns at its core.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from Hauser & Wirth.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

jorgge-menna-barreto,"Jorgge Menna Barreto presented a version of his durational project Environmental Sculpture, culminating in a mural at Bluecoat and a publication. The publication, Enzyme #2: Life Systems (2021), anchors on Menna Barreto’s research-based practice focussing on how our environment is shaped by what we eat and how we live. Bluecoat’s external wall space on Blundell Lane provided the backdrop for mural, Mauvaise Alphabet (2021). Interested in reorienting our relationship with the natural environment, the mural entangles drawings of common weeds found in Liverpool, creating a community of plants which are mostly invisible and many times unwelcome – even though they play a vital role in the ecosystem. Both the publication and the mural were produced in collaboration with other artists and thinkers, including Liverpool John Moores University students and local mural artist, Anna Jane Houghton.The above image gallery documents drawings by Liverpool John Moores University students.

invernomuto-jim-c-nedd,"Invernomuto & Jim C. Nedd presented an immersive audio-visual installation titled GRITO – Las Brisas de Febrero (2021) at Liverpool Cotton Exchange Building. Based on music from the Northern region of Colombia, the work centres specifically on the village of Palenque which was the first free African town in the Americas, established in the 17th century by people escaping enslavement. Through exploring Colombian pico culture – where customised sound systems or ‘picos’ go head-to-head playing vintage AfroColombian records at street parties – the piece considers music as a form of knowledge, while tracing the history of picos as points of contact between West Africa and South America during the transatlantic slave trade.  Concerned with how our bodies register experience, the editing pattern of the film reflects patterns of hair braiding which were developed by slaves to transmit secret messages as tools of resistance. A layer of sound and history is added by two horn speakers that recite stories connected to the areas of both Palenque and Barranquilla.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial, with support from the Italian Cultural Institute in London, Q-INTERNATIONAL, Fondazione La Quadriennale di Roma, Fondazione Pietro e Alberto Rossini and Pinksummer, Genova Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

nicholas-hlobo,"Nicholas Hlobo’s sculpture is another work that reflects on the politics of gender. Balindile I (2012) was created by assembling pieces of rubber gathered from repair garages around Johannesburg. Due to its association with cars, rubber has become a symbol of masculinity in South Africa. However, Hlobo combines it with materials such as ribbons, using techniques such as stitching and weaving that are traditionally perceived as female activities. As such, he challenges gender-based assumptions about the division of labour. ‘Balindile’ can be translated as ‘those in waiting’ from Hlobo’s native language Xhosa, a Nguni language widely spoken in South Africa. The sculptures suggest bodily references rising from the ground, but also feel unsupported, as if the soft material may wilt or dissolve.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

erick-beltran,"Erick Beltrán presented Superposition (2021), a set of graphical drawings and corresponding sound pieces in taxi cabs around Liverpool, as well as at The Lewis's Building. Beltrán’s work revolves around his interpretation of forms and figures, which is informed by his research into the intersection between multiple paradigms – Cumbia music, proprioception, quantum physics, the primordial state, the psychopomp and collective psyche. Hinged on his deconstruction of Cumbia, Beltrán brings to the fore that there are multiple ways of being in the world beyond the conventional understanding of the individual. In this work, the existence is interpreted by the body through ripples and rhythm – pulling and drawing people in as though they are possessed. Once the unit is overflowed with a multi-layered presence, it transforms into a state that is visually a kin to a kaleidoscopic pattern. Different types of ontological frameworks and velocities are central to this narrative, including our perception of frequency, harmonics, bodily knowledge and dream states.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial.

ayesha-hameed,"Ayesha Hameed presented I sing of the sea, I am mermaid of the trees (2021), a newly commissioned multichannel audio and textile installation at Lush Building. Hameed’s installation follows the laying down of the first undersea telegraphic cable between India and Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century, that was precipitated by the six week delay for Britain to get news of the outbreak of the Revolt of 1857.Her installation moves this history underwater, taking us to battles against the forces of the seafloor, through the fragile nervousness of cable signals, and to the forests in Sarawak from where gutta percha was extracted by indigenous peoples to insulate the thousands of miles of undersea cables. I sing of the sea (2021) considers how communication can act as a kind of violence, transmitted across the seafloor, consolidating Britain’s imperial control over India. If Imperial Britain was the mother country and its colonies its offspring, then the undersea cable was a kind of pathological, strangulating umbilical cord. This is a subaquatic story of those offspring.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from Canada Council for the Arts and The High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom.

luisa-ungar,"Luisa Ungar presented a newly commissioned relational performance. A Regurgitation is a Song is a Spell (Consultations to recreate the colonial disease) (2021), offered members of the public a personal experience to engage directly with experts in clairvoyance through a series of weekly phone calls available by demand. Following the caller's inquiries, each conversation offered constellations that connect to Liverpool’s colonial history as a contact point for global trade, through the interpretation of various types of specific material located in the city. Based on reports of contagion, hygienisation and witch-hunting, the commission was inspired by official records, rumor and historical gossip. Ungar experiments with the conversational format as a way of reclaiming certain practices disqualified or marginalized by the modern-capitalist world, revising forms of deprivation of women's voices in connection to local history.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial.

roland-persson,"Roland Persson presented a diptych drawing and a sculptural installation at Bluecoat. Toying with the classical notion of still life within art history, Persson creates sculptures which raise questions about how society conceives and represents nature. Taking the form of an assemblage of plants, Persson’s hyper-real silicone work Mouth of Medusa (2018) is cast from moulds made from natural objects. The silicone pieces retain the original colours of the plants they were cast from due to the porosity of the materials used – confusing the boundaries between what is natural and what is artificial. The sculpture was presented alongside Persson’s diptych drawing Desire (Of a thoughtful kind) (2018) which resembles a botanical illustration of a leaf or a part of a cactus. Emulating and documenting nature using artificial materials, Persson’s assemblage of works consider society’s charged ideasand expectations for nature.Supported by Embassy of Sweden.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

Davids considers the anatomy, behaviour, and movements of these birds – exploring what it means to migrate, to study and be studied.This research has compelled Davids to reflect on modes and categories of togetherness. Such kinships transcend fixed, physical geographies, establishing points of connection across generations and diverse cultural backgrounds.Davids engaged with a local kinship group, introducing them to the Feldenkrais Method in weekly sessions; Slow sequential patterns of movement that cultivate awareness – excavating bodily knowledge – an archaeological performance and practice of care directed towards oneself.

larry-achiampong,"Larry Achiampong presented a series of eight different Pan African flags, exhibited across ten locations, on buildings and streets throughout Liverpool city centre. With some designs featuring 54 stars that represent the 54 countries of Africa, the flags evoke solidarity and collective empathy – while some of the locations speak to Liverpool’s connection with the enslavement of West Africans as part of the transatlantic slave trade. The colours of the flags reflect Pan African symbolism: green, black and red represent Africa’s land, people and the struggles the continent has endured respectively, while yellow-gold represents a new dawn and prosperity. Achiampong has configured these colours into icons that are suggestive of community, motion and the human figure in ascension.For Liverpool Biennial 2021, four of the artist’s flags from his original series were shown - Ascension, Community, Motion and Squadron - as well as four new flag designs that generate new symbolic constitutions;What I hear I Keep – related to the act of sending and receiving messages that resonate.Dualities – related to the connection between those born within the African continent and those of the African Diaspora.Bringers of Life – related to the eternal reverence of the elements that bring and fortify life.Mothership – in praise, honour and respect of the centre of community; Black Womxn.Supported by The African Arts Trust.

Each goblet is filled with materials (“pollutants”) found in our everyday lives that arelinked to the disease, including food, medications, cosmetics and road dust. The Gut-Brain Axis (2020) and The Cardiovascular System (2020) consist of smaller sculptures on top of “drooping” granite tables. Inspired by feminist new materialist thinkers, Graff considers materiality to be relational and process-oriented, characterised by permeability, entanglements and relations, rather than reduced to a single identity. Positioning the body as a meeting place contained within a larger system, Graff’s sculptures are bodies in themselves, where entangled narratives and materials meet, both conceptually and materially.Supported by Office for Contemporary Art Norway and Royal Norwegian Embassy in London.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

dr-lakra,"Dr. Lakra created a series of drawings for the visual identity of Liverpool Biennial 2021. Lakra is well known for his drawing practice, inspired by the history of tattooing – a practice across the globe since Neolithic times re-introduced to the Western modern world after an increase in popularity amongst British and American sailors in 1700s. His images transform and translate the conceptual ideas and entry points of the Biennial, combining body parts and Liverpudlian landscapes.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial.

jade-fadojutimi,"Jadé Fadojutimi presents a series of large-scale paintings at Bluecoat. Using oils and oil sticks on canvas, the artist captures scenes of the familiar and the unfamiliar. Depicting complex emotional landscapes, the paintings reflect her self-image, thought process and the environments she works within. For Fadojutimi, the stretched canvas provides a physical space onto which the material of the paint itself has the power to assume a vast range of identities, reflecting the fluidity and multiplicity of the human experience. Contemplating on the notions of identity, Fadojutimi moves between abstraction and figuration in her attempt to recognise a sense of place in uncertain worlds.Courtesy of the artist, Pippy Houldsworth Gallery, London and Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne.

david-zink-yi,"David Zink Yi presented the two-channel video installation Horror Vacui (2009) at Dr Martin Luther King Jr. building. The work operates as an extended picture without a beginning nor an end. The film centers around De Adentro y Afuera, a Latin band founded by Zink Yi and Cuban musicians, and combines footage of their rehearsals with images of ceremonial rituals rooted in Afro-Cuban culture. The emphasis is on the role of the rituals in the production of the music and vice versa. The ceremonies documented in the film, known as Cajon, Tambor Batá and Wiro, relate to the African diasporic religions Palo Congo and Santería and the religion of the the Yoruba people – whose spirituality and culture originates in Nigeria, Benin and in the Congo Basin and lies at the root of different religious traditions in the Americas today due to the African Diaspora. In Zink Yi’s work, the band rehearsals and music filled with religious rituals are equally positioned as spaces where collective and individual identities can develop outside of oppressive power structures – as alternatives to relationships built on extraction and inferiority.Amidst the vast web of collaboration and dependency, which links the protagonists of both social universes, Horror Vacui permits the spectator to become a channel, unifying fragments and intervals, immersing us in the colourful and seductive universe of Afro-Cuban music, whilst paying homage to the endless performative power of all the participants.Supported by Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

jes-fan,"Jes Fan presented three new works at The Lewis’s Building titled Network (For Staying Low to the Ground) (2021), Network (For Survival) (2021) and Network (For Dispersal) (2021), as part of his series Networks (2020-ongoing). The sprawling new work takes the form of an entangled network of borosilicate tubing, punctuated with biomorphic forms. Fan’s sculptures are both a vessel and an interior body showing both the similarities and the differences between them. The sculpture is an incubator for black mould, which stands in for both a racialised fear of contamination, but also a sign of growth – a system of interspecies kinship. It describes a way of learning to care for what is not human.Supported by Empty Gallery, Canada Council for the Arts, Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London, and The High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom.

ines-doujak-john-barker,"Ines Doujak and John Barker presented film work, Masterless Voices (2014), at Tate Liverpool and a new podcast series on the history of pandemics titled Transmission: A series of five Podcasts on Disease and Pandemics in a Distorted World (2021).Interested in uncovering how histories of globalisation impact contemporary socio-cultural conditions, Masterless Voices retraces the roots of carnival to patterns of extraction, labour, and trade, but also to rebellion and joy. The podcast series looks at the social and cultural history of pandemics, beginning with the global transmission of diseases that was facilitated by European colonialism. Interwoven with spoken word, music and songs, Doujak and Barker consider how the spread of disease, parasite and infestation throughout history has created a dehumanised language, which has entered political vocabulary, specifically directed at migrants, minorities and the poor.Ines Doujak and John Barker have collaborated since 2010. They work together through a common interest in the political dimension of cultural exchanges.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial.

kekeca,"KeKeÇa Body Percussion Ensemble delivered a series of digital interactions, including performances and virtual lessons with participating groups, throughout the duration of the Biennial. Acknowledging the body as a place of lived experience, audiences were encouraged to participate using their own bodies as percussive instruments. Positioning sound as a form of knowledge, KeKeÇa’s practice engages bodies in the state of being present while the resulting sounds and rhythms invoke histories of movement and migration. Through pre-recorded and live streamed workshops, initially running throughout a network of schools in Liverpool as a key part of the Biennial’s learning programme, KeKeÇa opened up the workshops to wider audiences, empowering intergenerational participants to connect and collaborate.Discover all KeKeÇa online resources hereCommissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from SAHA Association and The Medicash Foundation.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

ithell-colquhoun,"Three paintings by Ithell Colquhoun from Tate’s collection – Earth Process (1940), Volcanic Landscape (1941), and Three Elements (1940-2) – were presented at Tate Liverpool. Colquhoun's paintings are concerned with natural processes, systems and cyclical renewal, referencing growth and decay as well as the four essential elements of nature: earth, air, fire and water. Working in the early-to-mid twentieth century, Colquhoun's works were created in a context where a modern understanding of natural processes and science was accelerating, but where science was more receptive to other disciplines and cultural interpretations. Colquhoun's paintings can be read as parascientific – drawing on her interests in Occultism and Surrealism as alternative ways of reading and situating oneself within the world. This particular collection of paintings depicts erupting ritualistic and rhythmic sequences of plant growth, atmospheric phenomena and volcanic activity. Colquhoun's paintings were displayed alongside the work of contemporary artist Linder, who created new collages responding to Colquhoun and their shared interest in the occult.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

diego-bianchi,"Diego Bianchi presented a site-specific installation at The Lewis’s Building. Bianchi is interested in how we are connected to objects and how they affect our everyday life; his works reconfigure our perceptions to create a spatial configuration indistinct of bodies and things. For his installation, Bianchi processed discarded objects, mostly car parts, and organic matter such as bioplastics – trying to force integration between conflicting worlds. The structures were complemented by the familiar, though often obscured sounds of the by-products of living bodily systems in their normal day-to-day functions, such as snoring, passing wind, exhalations and sighs. These sounds became the soundtrack to a series of videos where the adventures of strange characters with exceeded bodies were recorded. Creating environments that maintain an abstract quality mixed with precarity and humour, Bianchi’s fictional machinery of work replicates the process of the digestive system.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial with support from Amalia Amoedo and Érica Roberts.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

sonia-gomes,"Sonia Gomes presented four fabric sculptures at the Liverpool Cotton Exchange Building. Gomes constructs her structures using only materials that have been handed to her by others – taking on errant leftovers and combining them to create sites of intense encounter and entanglement. Mainly consisting of second-hand clothing and wires, Gomes’s transformation of disowned and unwanted materials gives them a new significance and life. The sculptures metaphorically bear the memories of the materials’ original owners, tying together their collective consciousness to create a knotty and guttural form. Gomes trusts that every material is imbued with latency of life, imagining her sculptures as bodies that absorb and retell the multiple memories of the ‘Other’.This loan is supported by the British Council.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

judy-chicago,"Judy Chicago’s series of lithographs Through the Flower No. 2-4 (1972), and What is Feminist Art? (1977), from Tate’s collection were presented at Tate Liverpool. Chicago is widely regarded as a pioneer of feminist art whose work elevates her experience as a woman artist and gives space to the work of other women. Part of Chicago’s early feminist images, her series of paintings Through the Flower (1972) and What is Feminist Art? (1977) bring together imagery depicting childbirth and growth and question the place of male aggression in art history. Imbued with the iconography and symbolism of birth cycles, these paintings are representative of an important shift in her artistic practice in the 1970s.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

christopher-cozier,"Christopher Cozier presented a series of newly commissioned drawings at Lush Building. A continuation of his Dark Circles project (2014-ongoing), the work, turbulence (2019–2021), responds to the threat of the global petroleum economy on the social space and on the environment. Exploring the modern economic and environmental history, Cozier extends the notion of the Caribbean as a space where transnational trading of bodies and raw materials largely drove the global modern economy. Interested in Sylvia Wynter’s rethinking of what constitutes “human” and Amitav Ghosh’s questions on ecology, imagination and science fiction, Cozier’s drawings depict mysterious hybrid creatures which represent the entanglement and assimilation of Carribbean and world histories.Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.

haroon-mirza,"Haroon Mirza’s presentation for Liverpool Biennial 2021 comprised of two elements: a three-part video work, Pathology in Three Parts (2021) and a new choral performance The Three /\/\/’s (2021).The Three /\/\/’s (2021) explores social gatherings and ritual and is informed by the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio – a mathematical phenomenon visible throughout nature and often applied in classical art. This performance, featuring Liverpool based singers, was documented with the resulting footage forming the central element of the new three-part video work. In collaboration with Mirza, Jennifer John led the ensemble of composers and performers made up of Anne Taft, Emma Bispham, Jennifer John, Steve Boyland and Tayo Aluko in order to evolve the vocal interpretations of the ritual.Pathology in Three Parts (2021) follows Mirza’s “modular opera” structure, and features two scenes or “acts” from a previous iteration, Construction of an Act (2019), either side of this new performative element. As new acts join the repertoire, the narrative, based around a shaman who uses her voice to heal, unfolds exploring ideas of sound, medicine and mystical experience. Both works ask us to consider the sociological and physiological properties of the human voice, and explores Mirza's interest in systems of belief, waveforms and patterns of movement.Pathology in Three Parts (2021), features on Mirza’s latest album released in digital format on the TAKUROKU label as part of a collaboration with Café OTO.

alice-channer,"Alice Channer presented a series of sculptures and pleated fabric prints at The Lewis’s Building. In the assembled works, Channer mimics a geological process that happens on a massively non-human scale using industrial processes that operate on a human scale – a deliberate conflation of scales and kinds of body. Loosely resembling natural rock formations, such as ammonite fossils, Channer’s large-scale sculptures represent the passing and scale of geological time. Bone-shaped structures, created by the application of multiple distortion, stretching and casting techniques, show strata-like ridges on their surfaces. Seeing a bone-like structure amplified to such a degree challenges our perception of what we are made of. The new series of fabric prints show rows of pinetree pleats, induced by a specialist technique that is usually reserved for the fashion industry. The pleating process is considered to be similar to the geological processes involved in the formation of the rock. Channer imagines the pleats as a kind of pleated skin that is porous to different processes, scales and time.Channer’s sculptures were accompanied by the first instalment of new, multi-part audio work by SHELL LIKE (Amy Lay-Pettifer and Fer Boyd). FIRST BIRTH occupies warm shallow waters, expansive sands, rockpools and motorway sidings, voices passing between human, non-human and elemental bodies. Beginning in lapping primordial excavations, zooming close-up to porous rock surfaces, tuning in to dialogues between whirlpools and following the libidos of a human-ish body as it traverses the city - the audio imagines different shapes for the body to rest in - new coils with a hole for your skeleton - that echo the sculptures’ own capacity for horizontal expansion and s-t-r-e-t-c-h.Our full exhibition programme is now closed, but visitors can still enjoy art in person at FACT and Bluecoat until August & September.
